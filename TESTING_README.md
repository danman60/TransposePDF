## üéØ Critical Success Criteria

For **mission-critical worship use**, these tests ensure:

1. **Reliability**: No crashes or errors during live service
2. **Accuracy**: Chord transpositions are musically correct
3. **Performance**: Fast loading and responsive interactions
4. **Usability**: Clear visibility under stage lighting conditions
5. **Compatibility**: Works across worship team devices
6. **Robustness**: Handles various songbook formats gracefully

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Test fails to start:**
- Ensure TransposePDF app is running at `http://localhost:8000/`
- Check that the test songbook PDF exists at the specified path
- Verify Playwright is installed: `npm list playwright`

**PDF not found error:**
- Update the PDF path in each test file if your songbook is located elsewhere
- Ensure the PDF file is readable and not corrupted

**Browser timeout:**
- Large songbooks may take longer to process
- Increase timeout values in test files if needed
- Check system performance and available memory

**Screenshot/report errors:**
- Ensure write permissions to the test_results directory
- Check available disk space

### Customizing Tests

**Change PDF path:**
```javascript
// In each test file, update this line:
const pdfPath = 'D:\\Downloads\\Your-Songbook-Name.pdf';
```

**Adjust timeouts:**
```javascript
// Increase processing timeout for large PDFs:
await this.page.waitForSelector('#songsSection', { 
  state: 'visible',
  timeout: 120000 // 2 minutes instead of 1
});
```

**Add custom assertions:**
```javascript
// Add your own test criteria:
this.assert(condition, 'Your custom validation message');
```

## üìà Interpreting Results

### Success Rates
- **95-100%**: Excellent - Ready for live worship use
- **85-94%**: Good - Minor issues to address
- **70-84%**: Fair - Several issues need attention
- **Below 70%**: Poor - Significant problems require fixing

### Performance Benchmarks
- **PDF Loading**: Should complete within 30 seconds for typical songbooks
- **Transposition**: Should be instantaneous (< 500ms per song)
- **Export**: Should complete within 2 minutes for full songbooks
- **Layout Changes**: Should render within 100ms

### Visual Verification
Always review the screenshots in `test_results/` to visually confirm:
- Text is clear and readable
- Layout looks professional

## üìû Support

For issues with the testing framework:
1. Check the error logs in test reports
2. Review screenshots for visual clues
3. Verify app prerequisites are met
4. Test with a smaller/simpler PDF first

Remember: These tests are designed to ensure **mission-critical reliability** for live worship services. Take any failures seriously and address them before depending on the tool during actual church services.
