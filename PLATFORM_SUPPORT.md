- **Vimeo**: Good support for public videos
- **Daily Motion**: Generally works well
- **Twitch**: Clips and VODs supported

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Support (May Require Authentication)**
- **Instagram Reels**: Technically supported but has significant limitations

- **Geo-blocked Videos**: Depends on your location
- **Age-restricted Content**: May need authentication

## üîç **Instagram & Facebook Reality Check**

**Based on testing, here's what you can expect:**

### Instagram Reels
- **Technical Support**: ‚úÖ yt-dlp has Instagram extractors
- **Practical Reality**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGHLY LIMITED**
- **Main Issues**:
  - Instagram API restrictions
  - Login walls for most content
  - Rate limiting
  - Frequent breaking changes

**Success Scenarios:**
- Some older public posts may work
- Requires cookies/authentication for reliable access
- Very inconsistent results

### Facebook Reels
- **Technical Support**: ‚úÖ yt-dlp has Facebook extractors
- **Practical Reality**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERY LIMITED**
- **Main Issues**:
  - Facebook's aggressive anti-scraping measures
  - Login requirements for most content
  - Frequent API changes
  - Privacy restrictions

## üìä **Realistic Expectations by Platform**

| Platform | Success Rate | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| YouTube | ~95% | Most reliable platform |
| Vimeo | ~90% | Good for public videos |
| Instagram | ~20% | Mostly requires authentication |
| Facebook | ~15% | Very restrictive |
| TikTok | ~30% | Varies by region/content |
| Twitter/X | ~60% | Depends on privacy settings |

## üõ† **Workarounds for Social Media Platforms**

### For Better Instagram/Facebook Success:

1. **Authentication Method** (Advanced Users):
   ```bash
   # You could extend the tool to support cookies
   --cookies-from-browser chrome
   ```

2. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Use browser extensions to download video files
   - Then use SoloTranscribeCLI on local files (would need modification)

3. **Public Content Only**:
   - Focus on public posts/accounts
   - Older content may have better success rates

## üöÄ **Recommended Usage Strategy**

### High Success Workflow:
```bash
# Reliable platforms for batch processing
echo "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..." > reliable_urls.txt
echo "https://vimeo.com/123456" >> reliable_urls.txt
solotranscribe run --in reliable_urls.txt --out ./output --format txt,json
```

### Experimental Social Media:
```bash
# Test individual URLs first
echo "https://www.instagram.com/reel/..." > test_instagram.txt
solotranscribe dryrun --in test_instagram.txt
# Then try processing (expect failures)
```

## üìù **Updated Tool Behavior**

The SoloTranscribeCLI will handle social media gracefully:

1. **Attempt Download**: Try the URL with yt-dlp
2. **Classify Failures**:
   - `access_denied` for login-required content
   - `invalid_url` for unsupported formats
   - `download_failed` for other issues
3. **Continue Processing**: Don't stop batch on social media failures
4. **Detailed Reporting**: Show exactly what failed and why

## ‚úÖ **Best Practices for Real-World Use**

### Recommended Approach:
1. **Start with YouTube/Vimeo** for reliable batches
2. **Test social media URLs individually** before batch processing
3. **Use mixed batches** but expect some failures
4. **Leverage retry mechanism** for intermittent failures

### Sample Mixed Batch:
```
# urls.txt - Mixed platform batch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ    # High success
https://vimeo.com/148751763                     # High success
https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123/          # Low success (will try)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw    # High success
```

**Expected Result**: 75% success rate (3/4 URLs)

## üîÆ **Future Improvements**

Potential enhancements for better social media support:
1. **Browser Integration**: Use browser cookies for authentication
2. **Manual Upload**: Allow processing of downloaded video files
3. **Platform-Specific Options**: Custom settings per platform
4. **Smart Retry**: Different retry strategies for different platforms

---

**Bottom Line**: The tool **technically supports** Instagram and Facebook reels through yt-dlp, but **practical success rates are low** due to platform restrictions. YouTube and Vimeo remain the most reliable options for batch processing.
